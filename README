Dynamics Piston Project 


Compilation pre-requisites:
    - MATLAB installed along with the addon Symbolic Toolbox 
    - A valid LaTeX compilation engine, such as pdflatex 
        - This should include a latexmk executable in your PATH

Inside your shell, run the following commands (the dollar sign prefix just means they're shell commands):

$ matlab -batch "piston_script; exit;"
$ latexmk document.tex

Depending on how you've configured your LaTeX engine, this will either ouput document.pdf or document.dvi, he final report.

If you do not have a valid MATLAB license or lack a license for the Symbolic Toolbox, you can try using FOSS alternatives that accept *.m files and see if they work. To be honest, the script likely should've been done in FOSS software from the getgo, but it is what it is.

Believe it or not, I'm being friendly to Windows users; these commands should probably be valid in a Windows environment, and MATLAB supports the -batch flag on Windows after 2019a or something like that. Pretty sure installing LaTeX on a Windows system adds latexmk to your PATH (after a restart, because Windows), but if it doesn't, a) that's a skill issue, and b) that's easily manually repairable by launching the GUI and instructing it to compile document.tex.
Fair warning, MATLAB does not seem to like the usage of the -batch flag, because it's hard to find documentation on (most of what you find is on the -r flag which appears to behave identically, except might not be available for Windows users) and a few things don't behave like their documentation suggests.
